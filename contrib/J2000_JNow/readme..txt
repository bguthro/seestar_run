This program performs coordinate transformations.

The option is to transform epoch J2000 to epoch on date (JNow) and vice versa

The window shows both decimal (1.25, 40.5) values as well the HMSDMS (1:15:00 40:30:00) values for both epochs

Especially useful when the telescope uses JNow and reference data J2000
